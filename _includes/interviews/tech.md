# Next Step: Technical Interview

* ### What to expect?
   * A 45 min interview through HackerRank  including two solos and one pairing. Each with a duration of 15 minutes.

* ### Can outside notes and resources be used?
    * The interview is closed-book (no notes or external websites). You may ask your interviewer questions related to syntax or your general approach to a problem.

 * ### What languages can I code in?
    * Ruby, Python or JavaScript.

* ### When can I run my code?
    * Code should be ran after a complete solution has been coded. If you would like to test the output of a certain variable you must first express to your interviewer what you expect to be returned to be granted permission to run the code.

* ### What is pair programming?
    * Pairing involves two programmers working together at one workstation each with a specific role. The driver types at the keyboard while the navigator directs the driver. Check out this [presentation][pair-pro-pres] for further clarification of what that means. The [presentation][pair-pro-pres] will also give you insight into how to successfuly demonstrate your collaboration skills during your interview.

* ### What does a successful technical interview look like?
    * A good gauge of your success during the interview would be when you have successfully reached a solution for both solo prompts. Effectively communicated your logic and approach for prompts. As well as, demonstrated to your interviewer that you are a team player who can work effectively in a pairing setting.
